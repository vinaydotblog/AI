<img src="images/Herbert Simon.gif" alt="Herbert Simon" style="float:right" class="auto-style1">"AI can have two purposes. One is to use the power of computers to augment human thinking, just as we use motors to augment human or horse power. Robotics and expert systems are major branches of that. The other is to use a computer's artificial intelligence to understand how humans think. In a humanoid way. If you test your programs not merely by what they can accomplish, but how they accomplish it, then you're really doing cognitive science; you're using AI to understand the human mind."
- Herbert Simon: from Doug Stewart's Interview with Herbert Simon
<br>
"From its inception, the cognitive revolution was guided by a metaphor: the mind is like a computer. We are a set of software programs running on 3 pounds of neural hardware. And cognitive psychologists were interested in the software. The computer metaphor helped stimulate some crucial scientific breakthroughs. It led to the birth of artificial intelligence and helped make our inner life a subject suitable for science. ... For the first time, cognitive psychologists were able to simulate aspects of human thought. At the seminal MIT symposium, held on Sept. 11, 1956, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell announced that they had invented a 'thinking machine' -- basically a room full of vacuum tubes -- capable of solving difficult logical problems.

<h3>DEFINITION OF THE AREA</h3>
<p>What is Cognitive Science. From Cognitive Science Major at UC Berkeley. "Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field that has arisen during the past decade at the intersection of a number of existing disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and physiology. The shared interest that has produced this coalition is understanding the nature of the mind. This quest is an old one, dating back to antiquity in the case of philosophy, but new ideas are emerging from the fresh approach of Cognitive Science."</p>
<p>Cognitive Science entry in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. By Paul Thagard. A solid overview plus links for further study: "Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence, embracing philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology. Its intellectual origins are in the mid-1950s when researchers in several fields began to develop theories of mind based on complex representations and computational procedures."</p>
<h3>GOOD STARTING PLACES</h3>
<p>Cognitive Science. By William J. Rapaport. Draft of the article in Encyclopedia of Computer Science, 4th edition; Anthony Ralston, Edwin D. Reilly, and David Hemmindinger, editors (New York: Grove's Dictionaries, 2000): 227 - 233. (PDF file) "The notion that mental states and processes intervene between stimuli and responses sometimes takes the form of a 'computational' metaphor or analogy, which is often used as the identifying mark of contemporary cognitive science: The mind is to the brain as software is to hardware; mental states and processes are (like) computer programs implemented (in the case of humans) in brain states and processes. ... Insofar as the methods of investigation are taken to be computational in nature, computer science in general and artificial intelligence in particular have come to play a central role in cognitive science."</p>
<p>A Brief History of Decision Making - Humans have perpetually sought new tools and insights to help them make decisions. From entrails to artificial intelligence, what a long, strange trip it's been. By Leigh Buchanan and Andrew O'Connell. Harvard Business Review (January 2006). "Future Nobel laureate Herbert Simon, Allen Newell, Harold Guetzkow, Richard M. Cyert, and James March were among the [Carnegie Institute of Technology] scholars who shared a fascination with organizational behavior and the workings of the human brain. The philosopher's stone that alchemized their ideas was electronic computing. By the mid-1950s, transistors had been around less than a decade, and IBM would not launch its groundbreaking 360 mainframe until 1965. But already scientists were envisioning how the new tools might improve human decision making. The collaborations of these and other Carnegie scientists, together with research by Marvin Minsky at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John McCarthy of Stanford, produced early computer models of human cognition -- the embryo of artificial intelligence. AI was intended both to help researchers understand how the brain makes decisions and to augment the decision-making process for real people in real organizations."</p>
<h3>GENERAL READINGS</h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence Tutorial Review. From Eyal Reingold and Johnathan Nightingale at the University of Toronto. "Welcome to the PSY371 Artificial Intelligence tutorial review. These pages were developed for the use of psychology students interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence, especially as it relates to the ongoing investigations in psychology aimed at understanding the human mind....This review has been designed with the expectation that its readers are new to the area, and care is taken to explain concepts fully. The review should provide an interesting and accessible introduction for beginners, but may be somewhat redundant for readers with more background in the area. Nevertheless, more advanced readers may find interesting links and demonstrations throughout the review. Also, in hopes of keeping the tutorial accessible, many of the more technical issues in AI have been simplified or avoided, with more emphasis being put on conceptual developments and interactive examples."</p>
