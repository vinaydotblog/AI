<p>AI in the News is a AAAI service to alert readers to current stories about AI that appear in various news sources. An AI program, NewsFinder, crawls the web to collect stories that mention a few key terms, like "artificial intelligence" or "robot", parses them, scores them with respect to likely interest to readers, and publishes the highest scoring stories here. NewsFinder uses a Support Vector Machine that has been trained to classify the interestingness of stories (and is retrained frequently from readers' feedback) to score every story, then adjusts the scores up or down using knowledge of words and phrases that indicate more or less interest.

We hope you will contribute your own ratings. If a story is not relevant to AI in the News readers, it warrants a zero. Otherwise, use the 1-5 scale to rate how relevant and interesting a story is to readers. Click on the Rate button to submit your rating.</p>
<h3>RECENT NEWS STORIES - MARCH 28, 2011</h3>
<ul>
<li>March 22, 2011: Aldebaran to create all-terrain disaster relief robots, make a hero of Nao?. Engadget. "Aldebaran robotics recently announced its intention to invest in and develop a range of robots that can traverse rocky roads to help in hazardous situations, citing the tsunami in Japan as a catalyst for the move. The company's yet to state how it will make this happen, but says it's already made contributions to Cap Robotique, the "French cluster dedicated to the development and innovation in the field of service robotics. Show full PR text ALDEBARAN Robotics to develop all-terrain robots to assist in hazardous situations (March 18, 2011 – Paris) While the benefit from robots assisting humans in hazardous situations, such as following the recent tsunami in Japan, is widely recognized and sought after, the few solutions which do exist are very limited. It is for this reason that ALDEBARAN Robotics has decided to develop and invest in a range of robots able to intervene in hazardous situations.<br/><hr/><br/></li>
<li>March 21, 2011: Surveillance robots know when to hide. NewScientist. "The creation of robots that can hide from humans while spying on them brings autonomous spy machines one step closer THE spy approaches the target building under cover of darkness, taking a zigzag path to avoid well-lit areas and sentries. With an aerial drone to their credit (see "Unseen watcher in the sky"), the company now wants to design autonomous robots that can operate around humans without being detected. Lead engineer Brian Satterfield says the robot was designed to operate within four constraints: "Avoiding visible detection by sentries of known locations, avoiding potential detection by sentries whose positions were unknown, avoiding areas in which the robot would have no means of escape, and, as this robot was designed to run at night, avoiding areas that were well lit. His comment is an example of how natural it is for us to talk about such robots as if they understand how they are perceived and have a "theory of mind.<br/><hr/><br/></li>
<li>March 26, 2011: Spiders and crabs inspire robot locomotion. BBC. "The walking patterns of crabs, lobsters and spiders are helping to inspire new ways of getting robots to move around. Closer study of the neural networks controlling the legs of invertebrates has revealed the rhythmic nerve impulses that govern gait. The rhythmic impulses are known as central pattern generators (CPGs), and are among the best known of all neural circuits, according to Fernando Herrero, one of the Spanish researchers employing them to control a robot. "CPGs autonomously generate rhythms without specifying any rule and thus can deal better with unexpected situations," he said.<br/><hr/><br/></li>
<li>March 21, 2011: Robot Swarms Could Help Search for Life in Martian Caves. Wired. " Autonomous swarming robots, programmed to search like honeybees, could be the best strategy to explore caves on Mars that may harbor life. ”Something interesting is going on down there,” said Ãron Kisdi, an engineer at the University of Southampton, U.K. “We just need to find it.” In a paper March 3 in Acta Astronautica Kisdi presents a strategy that he believes offers the best way for robots to search large expanses of Mars for new caves, maximizing search area and minimizing search time. In 2007 NASA’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft found seven large holes in the surface — too large and deep to be explored with rovers. “We have sent robots to mars a few times now,” Kisdi said.<br/><hr/><br/></li>
<li>March 25, 2011: Which sci-fi technology will become real?. CNN. "(CNN)-- Growing up, physicist Michio Kaku had two heroes. "Second?" he said. ' " Kaku, author of the new book"Physics of the Future: How Science Will Change Daily Life by 2100,"combines those two loves on theScience Channel, where he hosts "Sci Fi Science" and a tech-themed segment introducing reruns of sci-fi series "Firefly," which airs at 10 p.m. I figured out that the two passions of my life were the same thing." We chatted with Kaku about futuristic technology from our favorite science-fiction movies and TV shows.</li>
<li>March 24, 2011: Long-term study finds robot surgery safe. CNet. "Robot-assisted surgery to remove cancerous prostates is most common treatment in U.S. for treating localized prostate cancer, study says. The da Vinci Surgical System is often used in robot-assisted prostate cancer operations. Robot-assisted surgery to remove cancerous prostate glands is safe over the long term and has a major complication rate of less than 1 percent, according to research published by the journalEuropean Urology. An earlier study showed almost 87 percent of patients had no recurrence of cancer after five years, according to areleaseby the Henry Ford Health System. The institute is known for the work of Dr. Mani Menon, who has been performing robot-assisted prostate removals since 2001.<br/><hr/><br/></li>
